<p>The Boncuklu Excavation Module was prepared in 2014 for Dr Andrew Fairbairn, University of Queensland, to record data about the contexts and features excavated at Boncuklu in Turkey.</p>
<p>It is an adaptation of the standard FAIMS Excavation Module, and allows for the single context recording of deposits, which can be grouped into Features.</p>
